## Hi there 👋

🧑 My name is Jimmy

☀️ I am an incoming IT Intern for Oxy this Summer 2025. I'm interested in Cloud Computing and Software development. 

🤖 I am currently working on developing an AI agent to help businesses detect and mitigate cyber threats delivered via email or text messages. This system leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to analyze message content, identify phishing attempts, and flag potential security risks in real time.

☁️ I am working towards the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification.
