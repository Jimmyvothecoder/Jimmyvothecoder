## Hi there 👋

🧑 My name is Jimmy

☀️ I am an incoming IT Intern for Oxy this Summer 2025.

🤖 I am currently working on developing an AI agent to help businesses detect and mitigate cyber threats delivered via email or text messages. This system leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to analyze message content, identify phishing attempts, and flag potential security risks in real time.

☁️ I am currently learning cloud computing and working towards my AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification.
